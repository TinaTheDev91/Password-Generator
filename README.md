# Password-Generator
Password Generator application using JavaScript

## Description

This project was created to adhere to the common password standards out there currently. With the prevalence of data leaks and password compromisation, it is important to use an unpredictable password to avoid being a victim. This password generator will allow the user to customize the length of the password, as well as add or remove certain character types. In the process of creating this project, I learned how to use JavaScript as a core source for website functionality while also troubleshooting issues in regard to the flow of JavaScript code.
